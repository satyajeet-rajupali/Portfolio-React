    "desc": "I worked on reducing latency in UpsellService. I actively participated in the CI/CD pipeline to ensure the smooth and continuous delivery of high-quality software. I collaborated with the team to identify performance bottlenecks, propose targeted optimizations, and successfully contribute to the overall system optimization. This further strengthened customer satisfaction and retention. I have written clean and efficient code for the UpsellService. I have also written unit tests to ensure its functionality. Additionally, I have utilized Amazon's proprietary Datapath Query Language to optimize the code and reduce latency. As a result, the view level latency has been reduced by 80-85%, from the original 30ms to 25ms. At the service level, the latency has been reduced by 5ms."
