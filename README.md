# Portfolio-React

It’s a personal portfolio website hosted on Firebase, showcasing my professional journey. The website
includes dedicated sections for an 'About Me' introduction, educational background, project highlights,
internship experiences, and a contact form for seamless communication. This platform effectively
communicates my skills, achievements, and availability for collaboration with a user-friendly interface.
